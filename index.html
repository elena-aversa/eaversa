            <h1>elenaaversa7@gmail.com,<br>Information Designer and Post-Doc Researcher at DensityDesign Lab, Polimi.</h1>
            <p><strong>My name is Elena Aversa.</strong> I deeply enjoy conducting <strong>research</strong>, particularly when it involves data visualisation, digital media and information literacy, digital methods, and audience-centred approaches to evaluating visualisations. I hold a <strong>PhD in Information Design</strong>, a Master’s degree in Communication Design, and a Bachelor’s degree in Architecture.</p>
            <p>I’m passionate about <strong>teaching</strong>, both in academic settings and in collaboration with industry. My work spans <strong>data visualisation, graphic and editorial</strong> projects, as well as <strong>digital design</strong>. I also find joy in drawing, whether on paper or digitally using the iPad.</p>
            <p>At present, I carry out research at <strong>DensityDesign Lab</strong> and teach at Politecnico di Milano, Poli.Design, and NABA. I also collaborate with the University of Amsterdam as part of the Digital Methods Initiative’s Summer and Winter Schools. Previously, I have held visiting researcher positions at Aarhus University, Roskilde University, and Aalto University.</p>
